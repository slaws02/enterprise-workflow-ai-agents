# Enterprise Workflow AI Agents — Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains executive-focused AI workflow agents designed to improve implementation accuracy, operational throughput, audit readiness, and knowledge consistency in plan sponsor and benefits administration environments.

These agents demonstrate:
- structured workflow decomposition
- dependency and risk detection
- routing and triage logic
- configuration consistency checking
- knowledge drift detection
- QA-ready, auditable outputs

All artifacts use synthetic, portfolio-safe frameworks (no proprietary employer data).

# Agent Suite

## L1 — Implementation Risk Pre-Check Agent
Flags missing intake data, conflicting requirements, dependency gaps, and likely delay risks before build begins.

## L2 — Case Complexity Triage Agent
Scores incoming cases for complexity and routes them to the right queue/SME level, with escalation triggers.

## L3 — Plan Configuration Consistency Checker
Compares plan design intent vs configuration outputs to detect mismatches that lead to defects and rework.

## L4 — Knowledge Drift Detector
Identifies conflicting or outdated guidance across SOPs and job aids to reduce training error and inconsistency.

# Shared Knowledge Bases
Synthetic frameworks used to ground agent behavior:
- Implementation intake risk rules
- Complexity scoring rubric
- Configuration cross-check rules
- Knowledge drift conflict detection rules
