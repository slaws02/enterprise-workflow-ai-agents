PLAN CONFIGURATION CONSISTENCY RULES — DEMO (PORTFOLIO SAFE)

Purpose:
Synthetic cross-check rules used to compare intended plan design vs configured plan values to detect mismatches that commonly cause claims defects, member abrasion, and audit findings.

============================================================
PRIMARY CROSS-CHECK AREAS

1) COST SHARE ALIGNMENT
- Copay vs coinsurance must match plan design summary
- Coinsurance percentages must match benefit schedule
- No copay-before-deductible if plan is marked HDHP (unless preventive exception stated)

2) DEDUCTIBLE & OOP LOGIC
- Deductible amounts must match design
- OOP maximum must be >= deductible
- Family embedded vs aggregate must match design intent
- Cross-accumulator flags must match design notes

3) NETWORK TIER RULES
- INN vs OON cost share must not be identical unless explicitly intended
- Tier labels must match member materials
- OON coverage presence must match plan type

4) PREVENTIVE COVERAGE
- Preventive must show $0 member cost share when marked covered at 100%
- Preventive must bypass deductible if design says so

5) AUTHORIZATION / UM RULES
- Prior authorization flags must align with listed service categories
- No PA flags without service scope reference

6) PHARMACY / MEDICAL INTEGRATION
- Accumulator linkage flags must match integration notes
- Rx deductible linkage must match design summary

7) LIMITS & MAXIMUMS
- Visit limits must match schedule
- Dollar maximums must match riders/addenda

============================================================
COMMON DEFECT PATTERNS

- Deductible correct but OOP incorrect
- INN correct but OON copied incorrectly
- Copay entered instead of coinsurance
- Embedded family flag missing
- Preventive coded with standard cost share
- PA flag applied globally instead of by service
- Rx accumulators not linked when required

============================================================
OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS

Agent should:
- list mismatches clearly
- label severity (High / Medium / Low)
- explain why mismatch matters
- recommend correction checks
- recommend SME review for high-severity items
