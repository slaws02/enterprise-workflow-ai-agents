CASE COMPLEXITY TRIAGE RUBRIC — DEMO (PORTFOLIO SAFE)

Purpose:
A synthetic scoring rubric to triage incoming plan sponsor services / implementation operations cases by complexity and route them appropriately. Designed to improve throughput, reduce escalations, and match work to skill level.

============================================================
INPUTS THE TRIAGE AGENT SHOULD LOOK FOR

- Case type (implementation change, renewal update, eligibility, billing, reporting, ID card, vendor integration)
- Deadline / effective date proximity
- Number of impacted members / groups
- Number of systems or teams involved
- Presence of carve-outs / vendors
- Whether configuration changes are required
- Whether EDI changes are required
- Whether compliance/regulatory review is required
- Whether prior defects/escalations exist for the sponsor
- Clarity of request (clear requirements vs ambiguous)

============================================================
COMPLEXITY SCORING (0–100)

Add points when present:

A) Urgency (0–20)
- Effective date within 14 days: +20
- Within 30 days: +10
- >30 days: +0

B) Scope (0–20)
- Multiple groups or multiple plan options: +20
- Single group with multiple benefit components: +10
- Single simple change: +0

C) Cross-Team Dependencies (0–20)
- Requires 3+ teams (config + EDI + billing + reporting): +20
- Requires 2 teams: +10
- Single team: +0

D) Ambiguity / Missing Intake (0–20)
- Requirements unclear or missing key info: +20
- Partial clarity: +10
- Clear request: +0

E) Compliance / Risk (0–20)
- State mandate / legal language / audit exposure: +20
- Moderate risk (member impact, large dollar): +10
- Low risk: +0

============================================================
ROUTING RULES (BASED ON SCORE)

0–25: Tier 1 / Standard Queue
- Routine updates, clear requirements, low dependencies

26–60: Tier 2 / Senior Analyst Queue
- Multi-step updates, some ambiguity, 2-team dependencies

61–100: Tier 3 / SME + Program Lead Review
- High urgency, high scope, multi-team, compliance risk, unclear intake

============================================================
OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS

The agent should:
- produce a complexity score and reasoning
- recommend queue/tier routing
- list missing information
- list next actions to de-risk the case
- recommend escalation when score >= 61 or compliance risk is present
