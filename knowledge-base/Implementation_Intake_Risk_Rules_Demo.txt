IMPLEMENTATION INTAKE RISK RULES — DEMO (PORTFOLIO SAFE)

Purpose:
A synthetic framework to identify common intake gaps and risk drivers that cause implementation delays, rework, and downstream defects in plan sponsor services / benefits administration environments.

============================================================
REQUIRED INTAKE FIELDS (MINIMUM VIABLE INTAKE)

- Effective date and benefit year
- Plan type (HMO/PPO/EPO/HDHP)
- Funding type (ASO/Self-insured vs Fully insured)
- Network selection and tiering (IN/OON rules)
- Benefit schedule summary (copays/coinsurance/deductible/OOP)
- Accumulator logic (embedded vs aggregate; cross-accumulator rules)
- Prior authorization / UM rule changes (if any)
- Eligibility rules (employee classes, dependents, waiting periods)
- Enrollment method (834 EDI vs portal/manual)
- Vendor carve-outs (PBM, dental, vision, specialty vendors)
- ID card requirements (display fields, pharmacy fields if applicable)
- Sponsor reporting requirements (eligibility, claims, finance reports)

============================================================
HIGH-RISK FLAGS (COMMON SOURCES OF REWORK)

- Missing or conflicting effective date / benefit year
- Missing network selection or unclear OON rules
- Preventive coverage not explicitly stated
- Deductible and OOP not aligned with service cost share
- Family accumulator logic unclear (embedded vs aggregate)
- Pharmacy integration unclear (medical vs Rx accumulator linkage)
- UM/prior auth changes listed without code/service definitions
- Eligibility classes ambiguous (e.g., full-time definition missing)
- EDI timeline missing or no trading partner contacts
- Multiple carve-outs without clear responsibility boundaries
- Sponsor requires custom reporting without scope definition

============================================================
DEPENDENCY RULES

- Do not begin configuration until plan design + fees are approved.
- Do not finalize accumulators until deductible/OOP logic is confirmed.
- Do not start EDI testing until contact list + layout spec is confirmed.
- Do not finalize member materials until network and cost share are confirmed.

============================================================
OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS

The agent should:
- identify missing required fields
- flag high-risk conditions
- list dependencies
- recommend next best actions
- produce an executive-friendly risk summary
- recommend escalation when gaps are material
