KNOWLEDGE DRIFT & CONFLICT DETECTION RULES — DEMO (PORTFOLIO SAFE)

Purpose:
A synthetic framework for detecting conflicting or outdated operational guidance across SOPs, job aids, and internal knowledge articles. Designed to reduce training error and inconsistency.

============================================================
DEFINITIONS

Knowledge Drift:
When a document is older or not aligned with current process, causing guidance to diverge.

Conflict:
When two sources give different instructions for the same scenario (steps, ownership, timing, requirements).

============================================================
CONFLICT TYPES TO DETECT

1) STEP ORDER CONFLICT
- Sources disagree on sequence (e.g., "configure network before ID card" vs "ID card before network")

2) OWNERSHIP CONFLICT
- Different teams listed as responsible for the same task

3) REQUIREMENT CONFLICT
- Different required inputs (e.g., one says EDI contact required, another does not)

4) TIMING CONFLICT
- Different deadlines or cutoff windows

5) POLICY/PROCESS VERSION CONFLICT
- One doc references an older version of a process, template, or requirement

============================================================
SIGNALS OF OUTDATED GUIDANCE

- Mentions legacy tool names without current equivalents
- References old effective dates or old plan years as “current”
- Uses “temporary process” language without sunset date
- Contradicts more recent guidance
- Has no owner, no last-updated info, or unclear version

============================================================
OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS

The agent should:
- identify conflicts across provided excerpts
- label conflict type
- identify which source appears more recent (if dates are provided)
- recommend resolution actions (e.g., escalate to process owner, update KB, retire doc)
- propose a single consolidated “candidate procedure” when possible, marked as DRAFT
- recommend SME validation for final adoption
